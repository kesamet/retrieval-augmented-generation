DEFAULT_REACT_TEMPLATE = """Answer the following questions as best you can. \
You have access to the following tools:

{tools}

The way you use the tools is by specifying a json blob.
Specifically, this json should have a `action` key (with the name of the tool to use) \
and a `action_input` key (with the input to the tool going here).

The only values that should be in the "action" field are: {tool_names}

The $JSON_BLOB should only contain a SINGLE action, do NOT return a list of multiple actions. \
Here is an example of a valid $JSON_BLOB:

```
{{
  "action": $TOOL_NAME,
  "action_input": $INPUT
}}
```

ALWAYS use the following format:

Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action:
```
$JSON_BLOB
```
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

Begin! Reminder to always use the exact characters `Final Answer` when responding.

    """Create an agent that uses ReAct prompting.
    (https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/_modules/langchain/agents/react/agent.html#create_react_agent)

    Args:
        llm: LLM to use as the agent.
        tools: Tools this agent has access to.
        prompt: The prompt to use. See Prompt section below for more.
        output_parser: AgentOutputParser for parse the LLM output.
        stop_sequence: bool or list of str.
            If True, adds a stop token of "Observation:" to avoid hallucinates.
            If False, does not add a stop token.
            If a list of str, uses the provided list as the stop tokens.

            Default is True. You may to set this to False if the LLM you are using
            does not support stop sequences.

    Returns:
        A Runnable sequence representing an agent. It takes as input all the same input
        variables as the prompt passed in does. It returns as output either an
        AgentAction or AgentFinish.

    Examples:

        .. code-block:: python

            from langchain import hub
            from langchain_community.llms import OpenAI
            from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, create_react_agent

                }
            )

    Prompt:

        The prompt must have input keys:
            * `tools`: contains descriptions and arguments for each tool.
            * `tool_names`: contains all tool names.
            * `agent_scratchpad`: contains previous agent actions and tool outputs as a string.
